# EthernautWithAuditTools
Running various audit tools on the open zepplin ethernaut challenges.

## Overview
After completing Ethernaut, I thought it would be an interesting idea to
revisit using smart contract auditing tools.
The overall objective is to try and see how (if) these various tools can
be used to identify the various vunerbilities.

### Spoilers Alert
Having already completed Ethernaut, this project will describe and provide solutions.
If you have not completed it yourself, then be advised to do so, then
revisit here.

### Tools Used
Slither, Echidna, Mythril, Scribble, and (maybe) Mantcore.

__TODO__ - A lot more....
